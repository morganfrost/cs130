<!-- 
HTML creates web documents using markup tags
<html> has <head> and <body>
Body:
<body> can include images, videos, hyperlinks (links to other resources), containers, tables
</body>

HTML RULES:
FILENAMES:
- Avoid spaces, capital letters, special characters, whitespace (use underscore or no space) when naming files
- html files end with .html
- lowercase all file names
- Dashes and underscores are ok in file names

- Most tags have an opening and closing tag
<h1>MyTitle</h1>
But some don't

The browser ignores whitespace
<h1>MyTitle</h1> 
is the same as
<h1>              My
    Title
</h1>
BUT you should use indentation and linebreaks to make your code more readable

SYNTAX
tagname: img
attributes: could be an image, video, alt tag, etc.
ex. 
<img src="my_image.jpg">

Last in, first out (LIFO)
<p>Welcome,
    <strong>Leonard</strong>
